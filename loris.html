            The slow loris (Nycticebus coucang) is a strepsirrhine primate
            endemic to the forests of South and Southeast Asia. It is the only
            extant species in the genus Nycticebus. The slow loris is a
            nocturnal, arboreal animal, and is the only venomous primate. It has
            a round head, large eyes, and a snout-like protrusion. Its fur is
            typically brown or grey, and it has a long, prehensile tail. The
            slow loris is a solitary animal, and is active at night. It feeds on
            insects, small vertebrates, and fruit. It is a popular pet in
            Southeast Asia, and is often kept in a cage with a small tree. The
            slow loris is threatened by habitat loss and hunting for the pet
            trade. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.
